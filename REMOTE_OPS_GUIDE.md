# Remote Ops Agent — Usage Guide

Turn your Telegram into a powerful remote control surface for this workstation.

## Setup (one time)
1. Make sure the Telegram bridge is connected (`/telegram-connect` + `/start` in the bot)
2. Launch the ops agent:
   ```bash
   just personal-ops
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   pi -e extensions/personal-ops.ts
   ```

## Available Telegram Commands

| Command          | What it does                                              | Example |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `/capture`       | Capture any request and turn it into a tracked todo or memory | `/capture Fix the hero section on mobile` |
| `/plan`          | Create a multi-step plan with parent + dependent child todos | `/plan Build new landing page` |
| `/brief`         | Quick overview of open remote work                        | `/brief` |
| `/daily-brief`   | Rich daily/periodic summary with suggestions              | `/daily-brief` |
| `/remember`      | Store a durable preference or fact                        | `/remember pref.telegram_style: keep replies short` |
| `/handoff`       | Continue work that was handed off from desktop            | `/handoff` |

You can also just send normal messages — the agent will classify them automatically.

## Key Behaviors
- All created todos use `owner = "telegram-remote"`
- Plans create linked todos using `blockedBy`
- Handoff from desktop carries rich context (goal, accomplishments, current work, next actions)
- The agent follows `pref.telegram_style` when set
- After multi-step work, the agent can use `remote_verify`

## Handoff (Desktop → Telegram)
You can run `/handoff <note>` in a normal Pi session on desktop. This saves rich context (current work, accomplishments, next actions) so you can continue seamlessly from your phone.

The handoff file is injected only on Telegram-origin turns. It is marked `injected` before the turn and `acknowledged`/`pickedUpAt` after the agent finishes, so desktop sessions do not accidentally consume phone handoffs.

## Tips
- Keep messages reasonably short for best results
- Use `/daily-brief` at the start or end of your day
- The agent carries rich context during handoff for continuity
