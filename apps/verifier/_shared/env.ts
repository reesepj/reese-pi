/**
 * `.env` loader for verifier extensions.
 *
 * Both `verifiable.ts` (builder) and `verifier.ts` (verifier) call this on
 * session_start with their `ctx.cwd`. Each agent loads `.env` from its own
 * working directory — defensive: even if tmux drops env vars between spawn
 * and child, the verifier independently loads the same `.env` because it
 * shares cwd (the launcher passes `-c <cwd>` to tmux).
 *
 * Precedence (matches dotenv conventions):
 *   1. Existing `process.env` values are preserved (env-vars-already-set wins).
 *   2. Values in `.env` fill in only the gaps.
 *
 * `process.loadEnvFile()` is a Node built-in (>= 21.7). We're on 24.x, so no
 * extra dep needed. If `.env` doesn't exist, this is a no-op (silent).
